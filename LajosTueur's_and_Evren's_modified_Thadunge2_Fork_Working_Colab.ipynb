This will allow you to have edit and save permissions as well as your own copy. You can always return to this link to grab a fresh copy if you need it. Be sure to delete the AIDungeon folder from your Google Drive if you are trying to do a fresh install.\n",

        "So... I found a pretty cool way to play AI Dungeon long-term. This fork has some pretty nice mods. Read through the game's menus and instructions closely to make sure you don't miss anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "The best part for me has been the separate entries for context and prompt. It's also been very stable, so I haven't had to worry about crashes.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "These steps are optional, of course. If you are willing to put in a bit of effort, AI Dungeon 2 can change from a quirky little toy to a collaborative storytelling experience with an AI. Hopefully the project continues to develop and naturally become such an experience. Until then...\n",

        "+ **Come up with a good context.** This should describe your character and the world you want to play in. Some themes work better than others: generic (Tolkien) fantasy works great, describing a relatively obscure type of world such as Minecraft less so (I've tried). Don't be afraid to experiment and try describing things the way you want them. You may be surprised at how well the AI picks up on it.\n",
        "  + The AI will always remember this context, and in many cases that means associations you make will stick. For example, I told it \"your advisers are Lord Aethelwulf and Lord Juss\" and in the story said \"ask your advisers about this\" and the AI referred to them both by name and gave me their responses.\n",
        "    + It also seems to recognize family/relationships pretty well, although names are a persistent issue (easily fixed with /alter as needed). Don't be afraid to correct cases of mistaken identity with the tools you have available.\n",
        "  + There is debate on whether shorter or longer contexts are better. Here's my take:\n",
        "    + Longer contexts give the AI more to work with, making it less likely to make stuff up and more likely to follow your guidelines. Mine are longer because I describe the important people, places and events, and I've found the AI will often sprinkle these details in appropriately on its own or when I mention related topics.\n",
        "    + Shorter contexts give the AI less to start with, which means it is likely to come up with new ideas you may not expect. This can be fun too, especially if you're not sure or don't care what kind of adventure you have.\n",
        "+ **The prompt that the game asks you for next is temporary.** It will not be remembered after some number of turns (10-20?). Its purpose is to kickstart the story. Enter the immediate situation your character is in. The AI is likely to add to this after you submit it, so be aware of that. I do believe it will add to it whether or not you end with a period. Going without a period allows you to direct the AI into doing something specific.\n",
        "  + Example: \"You step outside your house and see \" will cause the AI to fill in what you see when you step outside your house. It may then add more detail/actions/dialogue afterward.\n",
        "+ **If you or the AI comes up with a cool plot point you want to be kept, use the /remember command.** This will commit whatever you write after /remember to the same permanent memory that holds the context. This really helps the AI continue along the threads it starts down.\n",
        "  + Examples may include new goals your character has, important personality traits or motives you learn about other characters, or new abilities/items you want to have permanently.\n",
        "  + This memory is only kept per save/session. If you start a new game or don't save your game, the game will no longer remember these once you start again. If you want it to retain the information over new games, add these details to your new context.\n",
        "+ **Recognize good stopping points.** If you want to try playing the same story long-term (like I do), this is important. \n",
        "  + When you come to a good stopping point, /save and copy the save code somewhere. I like to write a summary of the session or important events so I remember. \n",
        "  + Take a moment to revise your context. Add in any important details the AI should keep track of, such as anything you used a /remember command for. New pieces of equipment, new abilities, new relationships, new areas, new world events. It's probably a good idea to prune older concepts in these categories after a restart or two so that you keep the context to a reasonable length.\n",
        "  + Then, start a new game by typing /restart. Enter your new context. Come up with a new prompt that sets the stage for the next scene you want to play. (Apparently, the latest version of this fork has commands to edit the context while playing. Even if they work, I still think it's a good idea to restart occasionally to lessen the chance of crashes/loops.)\n",
        "  + Good stopping points include:\n",
        "    + A natural break in the story, such as a time skip. If you want the scene to change entirely, it's probably easiest to do so by making a save and writing a new context/prompt.\n",
        "    + A major goal in your context is met. If the driving force behind your character or story has changed, it's a good idea to /save and restart with a new context that includes the new goals. This way the AI doesn't randomly decide that the dragon you were sent to slay is still alive and you need to kill it again.\n",
        "    + You need to take an extended break. As you may know, leaving the browser tab alone for a while can cause it to disconnect. If you know you're walking away, at the very least you should /save so you can load up the state of the game you were on.\n",
        "    + The AI is breaking down. If you get stuck in a loop of some kind, try /revert until you get to a part you'd like to continue from and do a /save and restart with a new context. Dialogue loops, literal repeating content, complete gibberish, etc.\n",
        "+ **If the AI does something stupid**, such as making you speak out of turn or do something out of character (or an NPC who you feel has an established personality already), you have several options. \n",
        "  + Use the /revert command to undo and try a new command. This is the best option if you feel like something you typed was in error or you have a better idea to try.\n",
        "  + Use the /retry command if you like what you typed but don't like the response. This will usually come up with a new response altogether and will replace the old response (so you will lose it forever unless you manually /alter it into place).\n",
        "  + Use the /alter command to correct it. This completely replaces the previous response with whatever you type. Send /alter by itself first, then fill in your version of events as your next command. I recommend copying the original response first if you only plan to change a couple of things.\n",
        "    + This is useful for simply removing erroneous things, like if it threw in some nonsensical dialogue at the end of a response. The AI will act as if that never happened if you copy the original response, remove something, then paste it in after the /alter command.\n",
